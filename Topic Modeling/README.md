# Topic Modeling

- In machine learning and natural language processing, a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents. *(wikipedia)*
- Topic modeling is a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. *(wikipedia)*
- Intuitively, given that a document is about a particular topic, one would expect particular words to appear in the document more or less frequently: "dog" and "bone" will appear more often in documents about dogs, "cat" and "meow" will appear in documents about cats, and "the" and "is" will appear equally in both. *(wikipedia)*
- One of the technique in the field of text mining is Topic Modelling. As the name suggests, it is a process to automatically identify topics present in a text object and to derive hidden patterns exhibited by a text corpus. Thus, assisting better decision making.
- Topic Modelling is different from rule-based text mining approaches that use regular expressions or dictionary based keyword searching techniques. It is an unsupervised approach used for finding and observing the bunch of words (called “topics”) in large clusters of texts.
- Topics can be defined as “a repeating pattern of co-occurring terms in a corpus (a collection of written texts)”. A good topic model should result in – “health”, “doctor”, “patient”, “hospital” for a topic – Healthcare, and “farm”, “crops”, “wheat” for a topic – “Farming”.
