# Topic Modeling

- In machine learning and natural language processing, a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents. *(wikipedia)*
- Topic modeling is a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. *(wikipedia)*
- Intuitively, given that a document is about a particular topic, one would expect particular words to appear in the document more or less frequently: "dog" and "bone" will appear more often in documents about dogs, "cat" and "meow" will appear in documents about cats, and "the" and "is" will appear equally in both. *(wikipedia)*
